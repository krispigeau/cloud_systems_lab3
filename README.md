Hey Felix instead of making my own modules, I played around with using pre-made modules.

I made variables to use as inputs for these modules. Also, their outputs we conusmed by other modules.

The modules can be found here:


[aws-vpcs] https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest?tab=inputs

[aws-security-groups] https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws/latest?tab=inputs

[aws-ec2] https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws/latest?tab=inputs


I got the idea from here:
